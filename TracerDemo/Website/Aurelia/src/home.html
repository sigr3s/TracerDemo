  <p>au.Net.Mongo, is the latest in my software development passions. This application is created with <a href="http://aurelia.io" target="_blank">Aurelia</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windowscmd" target="_blank">.NET Core</a>, and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>.</p>

  <p>This application consumes an API, built with Asp .NET Core. I love .NET Core. This application has the latest changes I like to put in my API projects.</p>

  <p>This project uses MongoDB as a database. If you haven't tried MongoDB, give it a shot. I became very excited about MongoDB in 2015. I completed several courses and have since, been very pleased with MongoDB - from both as a developer, and as a DBA.</p>

  <h3>Developer Choices</h3>

  <p>For the past few years, I have been a big supporter of AngularJS. When I started learning <a href="http://angular.io" target="_blank">Angular 2+</a>, I became frustrated with the new syntax, and that it didn't seem like Angular followed good web standards. I stumbled across <a href="http://aurelia.io" target="_blank">Aurelia</a>.  Aurelia accomplishes the same things as Angular, but I feel like it follows good web standards, and has a cleaner syntax, and takes advantage of ES6 - instead of TypeScript.  My current preference for frontend web development is to use Aurelia. I felt it would be a good exercise to create the same application in Aurelia and Angular. Compare this Aurelia app with the Angular version: <a href="https://ngnetmongo.bckbtn.com" target="_blank">ngnetmongo.bckbtn.com</a></p>

  <h3>About This Project</h3>

  <p>My goal with this project was to create a reusable project template with Aurealia. I've done this in the past with <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dahln.ngNetTemplate" target="_blank">ng.Net.Template</a>. ng.Net.Template uses AngularJS, and is several years out of date.</p>

  <p>This application is a simple Todo list. I created it with the following requirements in mind:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Aurelia Frontend App</li>
    <li>.NET Core API</li>
    <li>MongoDB</li>
    <li>Allow a user to register for an account</li>
    <li>Require a user to authenticate with a valid username and password to sign in</li>
    <li>Allow the user to manage a Todo list</li>
    <li>Allow the user to manage their profile information</li>
    <li>Aurelia - have a clean startup process (include determining if the user is already signed in)</li>
    <li>Aurelia - maintain session across browser/tab closing</li>
    <li>Aurelia - Use Bootstrap JS</li>
    <li>Aurelia - Use ES6</li>
    <li>Aurelia - Create a library of external services to consume. Inlude the library in any components that need to use a web service.</li>
    <li>.NET Core - build an awesome API</li>
    <li>.NET Core - enforce authorization for all web services</li>
    <li>.NET Core - Use JWT tokens for security. Store the token in a cookie.</li>
    <li>.NET Core - Use an antiforgery token</li>
    <li>.NET Core - Use dependecy injection</li>
    <li>.NET Core - Use MongoDB as the data store</li>
    <li>MongoDB - Store Data. Easy as that :)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Future enhancements I hope to include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Multi-Lingual Support (this will require adjusts to the API and the Aurelia app)</li>
    <li>Antiforgery Token</li>
  </ul>
